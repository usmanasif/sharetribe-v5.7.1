## How to handle Github issues

*(This document is targeted mainly to Sharetribe team, but it's also good information for anyone who is about to file a new Issue report)*

### New issues

1.  Is it a general question or a bug report?

    - *Question:* Leave it open for some time and see if it creates traction and discussion. If it becomes inactive, close it and add a friendly reminder that the [Community Forum](https://www.sharetribe.com/community/) is the right place for general questions and discussion.
    - *Bug:* Move on to step 2.

2.  Does the report contain enough information to reproduce the issue?

    - *Yes:* Try to reproduce it. Move on to step 3.
    - *No:* Add a label **[more information needed]** and ask more info.

3.  Can you reproduce the issue?

    - *Yes:* Add a label **[bug]**.
    - *No:* Close the issue, unless you feel this does needs further investigation. Leave the issue open and ask for further feedback from others, if so.

### Existing issues

- Is there an Issue with label **[more information needed]** and the issue reporter hasn't answered in two weeks?

    - *Yes:* Close the issue as inactive

- Is there an Issue with a label **[bug]** and you know how to fix it?

    - *Yes:* Do it!
